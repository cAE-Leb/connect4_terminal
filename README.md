# connect4_terminal
Building out Connect4 as a terminal game in python. Will eventually add a trained model to 'solve' the game

I built out Connect Four as a Windows terminal based game, in an effort to continue learning OOP, and writing code to _create_ something, as opposed to writing code as a tool. This project will be the first of several projects as I learn the ins and outs of computer science. 

Connect4.py is written in python, simulating the classic childrens board game. Next step is to train a NN to play the game with me.
